cpp-httplib
===========

Cloned from: [![](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/actions)

This is an update to the original cpp-httplib to enable non-blocking, long-standing transaction with a client. This update only includes the server code and removes all client capabilities. Additionally, the SSL support is untested in this fork.
